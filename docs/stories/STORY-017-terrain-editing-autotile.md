# STORY-017: Terrain editing with auto-tiling

**Parent:** [EPIC-006](../epics/EPIC-006-map-first-ui-and-edit-mode.md)
**Status:** open, blocked on decoding `TERRTYPE.LBX` properly
**Size:** large

## Why this is the interesting one

A save stores a finished **tile number**, not a terrain type (see
[../reference/classic-terrain-format.md](../reference/classic-terrain-format.md)). Painting "ocean" onto a tile
means choosing the right ocean *and* re-choosing the right shore picture for
every neighbour. That's the "hundreds of shore tiles" problem MMS users
fought by hand.

The original game has the answer on disk: `TERRTYPE.LBX` is its
neighbour-mask → tile table (with rotation flags). This is also where the
retired `SmoothingRules` work may come back, as a cross-check.

## What to do

1. **Tile number → terrain type**: derive from `TERRAIN.LBX` ranges (and
   check with the minimap colour table, entry 2). Document it.
2. **Decode `TERRTYPE.LBX` fully** and reproduce the game's choice: for any
   existing save, recomputing each tile from its type + neighbours should
   give back the tile number already stored (or explain the exceptions,
   e.g. random variants). That's the correctness test.
3. **Tools**:
   - *Paint type* (brush / fill): set types, then re-resolve the painted
     tiles and their 8 neighbours.
   - *Cycle picture* (MMS "L/R"): step through variants of the same type
     without changing the type.
   - *Stamp exact tile*: pick from a tile palette, or eyedrop any tile on
     either plane (MMS "Alt-F3/F4") and stamp it verbatim.
4. Rivers and node/volcano tiles: check how the game encodes them in
   `TERRTYPE`, and handle them or explicitly exclude them.

## Definition of done

- Recomputing `SAVE1.GAM` from types reproduces its stored tiles (with
  documented exceptions).
- Painting ocean into a landmass produces a clean coastline with no manual
  shore work.
